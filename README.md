### ✈️ Aircraft Itinerary and Crew Scheduling Problem (AICSP)
📍 EMI (2024)  
Worked on an **optimization problem** in the context of airline operations. The goal was to design an efficient schedule that simultaneously optimizes aircraft routing and crew assignments.  
🔧 Approach:  
- Modeled the problem using Integer Programming with operational constraints.  
- Implemented and solved the model using **Gurobi**.  
- Delivered visual analysis and KPIs including minimized delays and costs.  
🧠 This project sharpened my skills in combinatorial optimization and industrial operations modeling.

### ♻️ Multi-Criteria Decision Making for Solar Distillation
📍 EMI (Jan – Jul 2024)  
Applied MCDM techniques to compare and design solar distillation systems, considering criteria such as energy efficiency, cost, and sustainability.  
🛠️ Used:  
- MCDM methods(TOPSIS for commparaison and ENTROPY for weighting) for the best solar distiller alternative selection.
- Designed a Cascaded solar distiller with horizontal and vertical plates, our best alternative with Solidworks.
📈 Result: Identified optimal configurations for rural and semi-urban contexts with low energy access.
